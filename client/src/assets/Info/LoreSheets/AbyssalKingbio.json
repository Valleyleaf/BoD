    "AbyssalKingBio": "Spine, inheritor of famine and ruin. His reign over before it started. The kingdom of Skavara was constructed upon a glacier, a impenterable fortress of ice, granting refuge and safety for his people. But now, it hangs in the balance as the glacier that was once their safehaven has been split open by unknown forces. His father before him refusing to accept reality, died in self-imposed ignorance, passing the impending doom onto his son. Now Spine sits upon a throne with a cracking foundation. His people blissfully unaware of the impending doom that awaits them."
