## 📖 Lessons (What has this project teached me)
- Choose and research hosting platform beforehand. I went through 3 seperate platforms before landing with render.
- Go with a mobile first approach for css. It's easier to scale something up than it is to scale something down.
- Separating functions away from react components can make for cleaner code with proper documentation.
